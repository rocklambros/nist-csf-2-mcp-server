# Snyk (https://snyk.io) policy file

# Security policy for NIST CSF MCP Server
# This file documents accepted security risks with justifications

# The HTTP issues are intentional design decisions:
# - These development servers are designed to run behind TLS-terminating reverse proxies in production
# - HTTP is used for local development only
# - HTTPS can be enabled by setting ENABLE_HTTPS=true with SSL_KEY_PATH and SSL_CERT_PATH environment variables
#
# The following Finding IDs are acknowledged and accepted:
# - 029f4c94-8aa0-41cd-b48d-1719c6a1b48b: gui-platform/backend/src/server.ts HTTP fallback
# - 599231cd-ffd2-48ae-87fc-52f345519ad1: gui-platform/backend/src/server.ts HTTP for dev
# - 68535b3e-7198-4c47-a474-a07141236c50: gui-platform/gui/backend/src/server.ts HTTP fallback
# - d6c2eb86-4e60-4108-9b6b-a463f0296985: gui-platform/gui/backend/src/server.ts HTTP for dev
#
# These servers:
# 1. Support optional HTTPS via ENABLE_HTTPS environment variable
# 2. Are designed to run behind nginx/ALB with TLS termination in production
# 3. Only use HTTP for local development convenience
# 4. Have comprehensive security documentation in the code comments
