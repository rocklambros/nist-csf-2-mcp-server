   - Sector: "Healthcare"
   - Size: "large"
   - Contact: "Sarah Johnson" (sarah.johnson@healthcaresolutions.com)
   - Timeline: 12 weeks for full framework assessment

2. Once started, use check_assessment_workflow_status to monitor progress
3. Guide me through the authentic data collection process
4. Help me understand what real organizational information is needed at each step

This should create a proper audit trail and prevent any fake assessment data.
```

### Multi-Organization Assessment Management
```
I'm a consultant managing multiple client assessments. Help me:

1. Start separate assessment workflows for three different organizations:
   - Small retail company (4-week timeline, specific focus on PR and DE functions)
   - Medium manufacturing company (8-week timeline, full framework)
   - Large financial services firm (16-week timeline, full framework with compliance focus)

2. Show me how to check status on all workflows and track progress
3. Demonstrate how the workflow prevents data contamination between clients
4. Guide me through proper handoff procedures for client-specific assessments
```

## üîç Framework Query & Search Tools (3 Tools)

- Focus on functions DE (Detect), RS (Respond), and RC (Recover)
- Get comprehensive results with implementation guidance
```

### 3. Related Subcategories (`get_related_subcategories`)
```
I'm working on implementing access control measures. Please:
- Find all subcategories related to "PR.AC-01" (Identity and access management)
- Show me the dependencies and relationships between these controls

- Organization: "Global Finance Corp"
- Industry: Financial services
- Size: Large (5,000+ employees)
- Assessment type: Current state baseline

Include sector-specific risk considerations and compliance requirements.
```

### 5. Clone Profile (`clone_profile`)
```

```

### 7. Reset Organizational Data (`reset_organizational_data`)
```
‚ö†Ô∏è DESTRUCTIVE OPERATION - Use with extreme caution!

I need to completely reset all organizational assessment data while preserving the NIST CSF framework:

}

This will permanently delete:
- All organization profiles and associated metadata
- All assessment results and maturity scores
- All gap analyses, priority matrices, and implementation plans
- All reports, evidence, and audit trail records
- All custom configurations and organizational settings

This will preserve:
- NIST CSF 2.0 framework structure (functions, categories, subcategories)
- Question bank and assessment templates
- Implementation examples and guidance materials
- System configuration and baseline information

Use only when:
- Migrating to a new organizational structure
- Cleaning test/demo data before production deployment
- Starting fresh after major organizational changes
- Decommissioning old assessment data

‚ö†Ô∏è This action cannot be undone. Ensure you have backups if needed.
