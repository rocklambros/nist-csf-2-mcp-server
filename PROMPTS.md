# NIST CSF 2.0 MCP Server - LLM Prompt Examples

This comprehensive guide provides **optimized prompts** for using the NIST CSF 2.0 MCP Server with large language models like **Claude**, **ChatGPT**, and **Gemini**. These prompts demonstrate best practices for cybersecurity assessments and leverage all **36 MCP tools** available in the server.

## üöÄ Quick Start Prompts

### Initial Setup and Organization Profile
```
I need to start a cybersecurity assessment for my organization. Please help me:

1. Create an organization profile for "TechCorp Inc" - a medium-sized technology company
2. Perform a quick initial assessment to understand our current security posture
3. Calculate our initial risk score and identify the most critical areas for improvement

Use the NIST CSF 2.0 MCP server tools to guide me through this process step by step.
```

### Comprehensive Assessment Workflow
```
I want to conduct a comprehensive NIST CSF 2.0 assessment for my organization. Please:

1. Create a detailed maturity assessment across all framework functions
2. Generate a gap analysis comparing our current state to industry best practices
3. Create an implementation priority matrix based on risk and business impact
4. Develop a phased implementation plan with timelines and cost estimates
5. Generate an executive summary report for leadership

Walk me through each step and explain the results.
```

## üîç Framework Query & Search Tools (3 Tools)

### 1. CSF Lookup Tool (`csf_lookup`)
```
I need to understand the NIST CSF 2.0 subcategory "GV.OC-01" in detail. Please:
- Look up this subcategory with all available examples and references
- Explain how it relates to organizational cybersecurity governance
- Provide practical implementation examples for a healthcare organization
```

### 2. Framework Search Tool (`search_framework`)
```
Help me find all NIST CSF 2.0 elements related to "incident response" across all functions. I want to:
- Search for all subcategories containing incident response concepts
- Focus on functions DE (Detect), RS (Respond), and RC (Recover)
- Get comprehensive results with implementation guidance
```

### 3. Related Subcategories (`get_related_subcategories`)
```
I'm working on implementing access control measures. Please:
- Find all subcategories related to "PR.AC-01" (Identity and access management)
- Show me the dependencies and relationships between these controls
- Identify supporting subcategories that should be implemented together
```

## üè¢ Organization & Profile Management Tools (4 Tools)

### 4. Create Profile (`create_profile`)
```
Create a comprehensive organization profile for our company with these details:
- Organization: "Global Finance Corp"
- Industry: Financial services
- Size: Large (5,000+ employees)
- Assessment type: Current state baseline

Include sector-specific risk considerations and compliance requirements.
```

### 5. Clone Profile (`clone_profile`)
```
I have an existing organization profile (PROF-123). Please:
1. Clone it to create a target state profile representing our desired security posture in 18 months
2. Adjust the maturity levels to reflect industry best practices
3. Include aspirational goals for regulatory compliance
```

### 6. Compare Profiles (`compare_profiles`)
```

```

### 7. Reset Organizational Data (`reset_organizational_data`)
```
‚ö†Ô∏è DESTRUCTIVE OPERATION - Use with extreme caution!

I need to completely reset all organizational assessment data while preserving the NIST CSF framework:

{
  "confirmation": "CONFIRM_RESET_ALL_ORGANIZATIONAL_DATA"
}

This will permanently delete:
- All organization profiles and associated metadata
- All assessment results and maturity scores
- All gap analyses, priority matrices, and implementation plans
- All reports, evidence, and audit trail records
- All custom configurations and organizational settings

This will preserve:
- NIST CSF 2.0 framework structure (functions, categories, subcategories)
- Question bank and assessment templates
- Implementation examples and guidance materials
- System configuration and baseline information

Use only when:
- Migrating to a new organizational structure
- Cleaning test/demo data before production deployment
- Starting fresh after major organizational changes
- Decommissioning old assessment data

‚ö†Ô∏è This action cannot be undone. Ensure you have backups if needed.
```
